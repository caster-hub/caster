# Caster Subnet

This repository contains everything validator operators need to run a validator and everything miners need to build/test miner scripts and submit them to the platform.

## Packages

- `validator/` — validator runtime for operators
- `miner/` — miner-facing sandbox harness and local tooling
- `miner-sdk/` — SDK used by miner scripts
- `commons/` — shared utilities used by the above packages

## Entry points

- Validator operators: see `validator/README.md`
- Miner developers: see `miner/README.md`

## Incentive mechanism (overview)

This subnet rewards the best miner scripts by having validators run standardized tasks against them, aggregating results, and assigning emissions to a “sticky” top‑3 roster.

1) Miners submit scripts (code) to the platform.
2) The platform creates a run: tasks + candidate scripts.
3) The platform fans out the run to multiple validators.
4) Validators execute tasks against each script and return grades.
5) The platform aggregates validator grades into a ranking and computes weights.
6) Validators submit those weights on-chain (Bittensor).

```mermaid

  autonumber
  participant P as Platform
  participant V as Validator
  participant S as Miner Sandbox
  participant C as Bittensor (Subtensor)

  P->>V: Run (tasks, candidate scripts)
  loop For each script × task
    V->>S: Run script on task
    S-->>V: Miner response
    V->>V: Grade vs reference
  end
  V-->>P: Task grades (complete set)
  P->>P: Aggregate + compute weights
  V->>C: submit_weights(uids, weights)
```

### Sticky top‑3 roster rule

Only a top‑1 replacement updates the roster:

```mermaid

  A[New run ranking computed] --> B{Did a challenger replace top1?}
  B -- No --> C[Keep roster as-is]
  B -- Yes --> D[top1 := challenger]
  D --> E[top2 := old top1]
  E --> F[top3 := old top2]
```

## Local development
